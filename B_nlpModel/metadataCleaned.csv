We are a collaborative group of experienced Research Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers, whose academic backgrounds include doctorate degrees in NLP, theoretical physics, statistics, etc. We take pride in our team-based, tightly-knit startup-like Kenshin community, which fosters continuous learning and a communicative environment.

Since early-2022, we have been building a world-class R&D lab comprised of ML/NLP Research Scientists. Our small team has demonstrated compelling results and is fueling innovation throughout Kensho and S&P Global at large. Specifically, we are continuously building a domain-specific Large Language Model LLM and are actively working on question-answering QA, summarization, and document layout analysis.

We are looking to hire NLP Research Scientists with expertise in any of the following: question-answering, summarization, dialog system, reinforcement learning, and distributed systems. In particular, we are currently prioritizing question-answering and are addressing:

-Dialog-based QA that leverages APIs, program synthesis, and large knowledge-graphs/databases to help ensure accurate answers

-Long-form document QA, where the answer is expected to be contained within a user-specified collection of documents

-Math-based QA, where the answer requires automatically parsing tables for relevant information and then performing basic mathematical operations to yield the correct answer e.g, FinQA, TAT-QA, ConvFinQA

You will collaborate with our R&D team in conducting and publishing research in the top conferences.

At Kensho, we hire talented people and give them the freedom, support, and resources needed to accomplish our shared goals. We believe in flexibility-first and give our employees the opportunity to work from where they feel most productive and engaged must be in the United States. We also value in-person collaboration, so there may be times when travel to one of our Kensho hubs e.g., Cambridge, MA or NYC will be required for team meetings or company events.

Kensho states that the anticipated base salary range for the position is 150k-225k. In addition, this role is eligible for an annual incentive bonus and equity plans. At Kensho, it is not typical for an individual to be hired at or near the top of the range for their role and compensation decisions are dependent on the facts and circumstances of each case.

Applied Researcher,"About Antithesis

We believe the future of software QA is autonomous testing.

Significant fractions of IT budgets are spent on software testing, but too many bugs are still discovered in the most expensive and frustrating way: when a customer reports them in the wild.

At our previous venture, distributed database company FoundationDB, we pioneered autonomous testing methods that could catch nearly all bugs before they hit production, improving our software quality and significantly decreasing the time we spent debugging.

At Antithesis, we want to bring the confidence and productivity benefits of autonomous testing to our customers. We have developed a platform that searches for bugs in customer's software, in a controlled environment where all bugs are reproducible. Our first offering finds fault tolerance bugs: failures of customer's software that occur under specific network, hardware or timing conditions.

About the position

We're building a new type of product, and advancing that product requires research. As part of the Applied Research team, you will work with a small team focused on understanding and improving the capabilities of our product to find and resolve customer bugs. Your job will be one part science, one part engineering, and one part spreading knowledge.

We're doing things nobody has done before, so we don't require expertise with any specific language or framework, etc. Mainly we care that: you're smart, get things done, a joy to work with, and are comfortable dealing with open-ended/poorly-defined problems.

If that sounds like you, include with your resume a brief one to two paragraph explanation of an interesting technical challenge you've faced.

Scientist I Research Development,"Company Profile:

Vaxcyte, Inc. Nasdaq: PCVX is a vaccine innovation company engineering high-fidelity vaccines to protect humankind from the consequences of bacterial diseases. The Company is developing broad-spectrum conjugate and novel protein vaccines to prevent or treat bacterial infectious diseases. Vaxcytes lead candidate, VAX-24, is a 24-valent, broad-spectrum, carrier-sparing pneumococcal conjugate vaccine PCV being developed for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease IPD. The Company is re-engineering the way highly complex immunizations are made through modern synthetic techniques, including advanced chemistry and our exclusively licensed XpressCFTM cell-free protein synthesis platform. Unlike conventional cell-based approaches, the Companys system for producing difficult-to-make proteins and antigens is intended to accelerate its ability to efficiently create and deliver high-fidelity vaccines with enhanced immunological benefits. Vaxcytes pipeline also includes VAX-31, a 31-valent PCV candidate VAX-A1, a prophylactic vaccine candidate designed to prevent Group A Strep infections VAX-PG, a therapeutic vaccine candidate designed to slow or stop the progression of periodontal disease and VAX-GI, a vaccine program designed to prevent Shigella. The Company is driven to eradicate or treat invasive bacterial infections, which have serious and costly health consequences when left unchecked. For more information, visit www.vaxcyte.com.

Vaxcyte, headquartered in San Carlos, CA, went public in June 2020 and currently has a team of approximately 180 employees and anticipates continued, significant growth. Following equity offerings in October 2022 and April 2023, which generated over 1.1 billion in net proceeds, the Companys balance sheet is further strengthened to advance its pipeline of novel vaccines, including VAX-24. These financings followed positive data readouts from Vaxcytes Phase 1/2 proof-of-concept study evaluating VAX-24 in adults aged 18-64 and Phase 2 study in adults 65 and older. The Company believes these results support a best-in-class potential for VAX-24, which was designed to replace the current standard-of-care in adults and children. VAX-24 is being investigated for the prevention of IPD, which can be most serious for infants, young children, older adults and those with immune deficiencies or certain chronic health conditions. Given the global impact of pneumococcal disease remains significant, the public health community continues to advocate for vaccines that can offer broader protection to prevent IPD. Vaxcytes PCV franchise, consisting of VAX-24 and VAX-31, is designed specifically to address this need and has the potential to deliver the broadest protection for this very serious disease. We believe that our PCVs could receive regulatory approval based on successful completion of clinical studies utilizing well-defined surrogate immune endpoints, consistent with how other PCVs have obtained regulatory approval in the past, rather than requiring clinical field efficacy studies.

Summary:

Vaxcyte is looking for a conjugation Scientist, Research and Development who will contribute to the research and development of a novel bacterial polysaccharide conjugate vaccine. Specifically, this will include initial set up, synthesis, purification, and analytical characterization of chemically modified polysaccharides and polysaccharide-protein conjugates.
