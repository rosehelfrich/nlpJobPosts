About the position We're building a new type of product, and advancing that product requires research. As part of the Applied Research team, you will work with a small team focused on understanding and improving the capabilities of our product to find and resolve customer bugs.

Scientist I Research Development,"Company Profile: Vaxcyte, headquartered in , , went public in and currently has a team of employees and anticipates continued, significant growth. Following equity offerings in and , which generated over in net proceeds, the Companys balance sheet is further strengthened to advance its pipeline of novel vaccines, including VAX-24. These financings followed positive data readouts from Vaxcytes Phase 1 2 proof-of-concept study evaluating VAX-24 in adults aged and Phase 2 study in adults and older. The Company believes these results support a best-in-class potential for VAX-24, which was designed to replace the current standard-of-care in adults and children. VAX-24 is being investigated for the prevention of IPD, which can be most serious for infants, young children, older adults and those with immune deficiencies or certain chronic health conditions. Given the global impact of pneumococcal disease remains significant, the public health community continues to advocate for vaccines that can offer broader protection to prevent IPD. Vaxcytes PCV franchise, consisting of VAX-24 and VAX-31, is designed specifically to address this need and has the potential to deliver the broadest protection for this very serious disease. We believe that our PCVs could receive regulatory approval based on successful completion of clinical studies utilizing well-defined surrogate immune endpoints, consistent with how other PCVs have obtained regulatory approval in the past, rather than requiring clinical field efficacy studies.
